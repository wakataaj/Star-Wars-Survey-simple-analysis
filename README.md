# Star-Wars-Survey-simple-analysis

- This dataset contains responses from survey participants that ask about their favorite Star Wars movies, their rankings of the movies indivudally in regards to the others in the series, various other questions about the Star Wars series and also personal information such as median income, gender, age, among others.

- This is a simple data exploration project I completed in conjunction with the Dataquest.io curriculum, in the future I will be adding to this project in order to better my skills and find more interesting insights into this dataset.

- Credit to fivethirty eight for their plethora of datasets, I will be using them a ton to practice on, here is the link to their Github repository: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data
